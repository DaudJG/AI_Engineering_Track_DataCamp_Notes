# AI Engineering Track for Data Scientists (DataCamp)

## Repository Overview

This repository contains detailed Jupyter Notebooks documenting my progress through DataCamp's **Associate AI Engineer for Data Scientists** track. The track consists of 15 courses covering a broad range of topics, including supervised learning, deep learning, MLOps, LLMs, and more. Each notebook is structured with lecture summaries, code exercises, and real-world applications. Over **100+ hours** have been dedicated to learning and applying these topics.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse the Jupyter Notebooks in each course folder. The notebooks are self-contained, with explanations for each concept, code blocks, and real-world exercises. If you're new to a topic, I recommend starting with the course overview notebooks which provide an introduction before diving into the code.
